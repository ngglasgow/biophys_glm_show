- data
    - beta_slopes
        - contains the data for summed slopes for each basis function between changing conductance levels
        - also contains the actual lambda values used
        - and the optimal lambda value
        - with corresponding log likelihood values
    - glm_basis
        - the 
    - reconstructed_stimulus
        - data types
            *model.mat:
            *reconstructed_stim.csv: contains the 1 reconstructed stimulus from all of the stimuli
            *stims.csv: contains the 33 stimuli used, they are all the same for each channel as far as I can tell

        - TODO
            -check coherence between
                1. reconstructed_stim and each stimulus, then take mean
                2. reconsturcted_stim vs. mean of stimuli

            -rework code to test this, I think I already did this
            working on reconstruction_analysis, and testing the coherences

TODO
    -matlab_conversion.py
        -this file is working on making the labmda[0, max] of the slopes
        -need to combine this with GLM filters of before and lambda=*
        -renamed file to kA_slopes.py
            -there will be a file for each channel, I suppose
            -would be better to have one file, and then an argument that selects the channel and prints result
